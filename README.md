# Personal Server
This server will host my mostly static website. It is held in the `.gitignore`'d folder, '`public`'. It can be viewed [on its own repository](https://github.com/matthew-e-brown/Personal-Site).

Thanks to [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman)'s [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Yyn-fBtGHfN0_xCtBwUkBp) for teaching me the basics of Node, allowing me to port my site from a LAMP Stack server to a barebones Node+Express setup.

Thanks as well to [This tutorial](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/walkthroughs/deploy/nodejs/) on [Phusion Passenger](https://github.com/phusion/passenger)'s site for helping me deploy my Node.js 'webapp' -- even if this webapp was just a personal website.
