# Personal Site
My personal website. [Can be found here](http://www.matthew-e-brown.com)!

This website is hosted on an [Amazon Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/) instance, running a barebones CentOS 7. It uses NGINX, Passenger, and Node.js. The Node.js portion of the site can be found [here, on its own repository](https://github.com/matthew-e-brown/Node-PersonalServer).
